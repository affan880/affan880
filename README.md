# Syed Affan – Full‑Stack Engineer (AI Assistants & Tools)

I build AI‑powered assistants, bots, and internal tools on top of email, calendar, data, and marketplaces.[file:110] I like taking messy workflows and turning them into simple products people actually use.

## 🔧 What I’m working on

- **AI Shield** – AI‑powered code security assistant (next‑gen SAST) that analyzes code, traces data flow, detects vulnerabilities, and proposes fixes using a multi‑agent architecture.  
  _FastAPI, LangGraph, LLMs (Claude, OpenAI, Gemini), Postgres, Redis._

- **DuckPilot** – Browser‑based data assistant where non‑technical users upload CSV/Parquet and ask questions in natural language to get charts and insights.
  _React/Next.js, DuckDB‑WASM, LLMs._

- **Plexar** – AI productivity assistant on top of Gmail and Google Calendar that summarizes important emails/events and turns them into actionable tasks and reminders. 
  _React Native, Google APIs, LLMs (Cohere, Claude)._

- **Omi assistants** – Voice‑controlled bots that take spoken commands (e.g., “draft a follow‑up email”, “create a deck about X”) and then draft the email or generate the slide deck for the user.
  _Node.js/TypeScript, LLMs, email/presentation APIs._
